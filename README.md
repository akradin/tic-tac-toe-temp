## Tic Tac Toe Game!

This is a tic-tac-toe in-browser game. a spa developed by Joel Buzzanco for the General
Assembly WDI Project 1.

Deployed page on github: https://jbuzzanco.github.io/tic-tac-toe-temp/

I used HTML to provide the structure of this website, using bootstrap technologies to
help in creating the structure. Also used SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX, for the API,
to remember the passwords and user information.

## Planning
Follow my wireframes to write HTML and CSS. Get the basic layout working
    work on making it look better after it's working.
  commit as often as a new feature is working on GitHub.
  manage game logic code.
    write pseudo code first for game logic, then write javascript from looking at that.
  create a front end server for the project
  write jquery for user to interact with the game
    write the psuedo code for jquery, or at least plan it out first briefly,
    then write the JQuery.
  create the backend server.
  make requests with the server using curl to see if its working.
  once it is working, write the AJAX.
  create more features in the css to make it look more visually appealing with colors
  and fonts and font sizes.
    see if the layout can be displayed in a better way, visually/logically for the
    nav, player, game, and footer.
  Write a readme for the project to explain what it is and what it does in the
  GitHub repository.


## Actual Approach & Execution
My approach to this project was to start with the HTML, working from the top of the page,
to the bottom of the page. I used bootstrap to try and get the game boxes working, then SCSS, to
simply style the boxes to get borders. After that, I worked one on one with the Authorization,
to get sign up, in, out, and change Password to work, one at a time. After working on that
I began to take a look at the game logic, which I had a lot of trouble trying to get to work. I worked,
and got the clicking working, then began working on the different win patterns one by one. Finally I
began working on the game API.

One thing I might do next time is to work on multiple parts simultaneously once possible. You may,
have to create the HTML first to work on a lot of things, however, even then, when stuck on the HTML,
begin creating style in what I have, then go back to the HTML that I am stuck on. It may help with looking at
things with a fresh(er) pair of eyes.

For the future, I would create better style for the board and create a nicer sign in out UX so that it is
more modern and easier to look at. I like things to look great so design is one thing I would like to accomplish in a better way, with more time with this project.

wireframes for how I planned to approach the style of this project.
